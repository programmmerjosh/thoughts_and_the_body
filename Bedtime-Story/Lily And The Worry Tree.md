# Increasing Evidence That Emotions Matter, Clinically (Bedtime Story Version)

### 🩵 Lila and the Worry Tree 🩵
A gentle bedtime story about feelings and health

Once upon a time, in a bright little village filled with wildflowers and laughter, there lived a girl named Lila. Lila loved to climb trees, pick daisies, and make up songs with her big brother, Ben. She was kind and thoughtful, and she always noticed when someone else was feeling sad.

But one week, Lila got a little sick. She had a stuffy nose and a small cough, and her tummy didn’t feel quite right. Her parents took good care of her — she had soup, soft blankets, and books read to her by candlelight. But even after a few days, Lila didn’t feel much better.

That night, as she lay in bed, Lila whispered, “Why is it taking so long to get well?”

Her mother brushed her hair gently and said, “Well, sweetheart, sometimes our feelings can make it harder for our bodies to heal.”

Lila’s eyes widened. “You mean... like being sad or scared?”

Her mom nodded. “Exactly. When we’re scared or worried, our body works really hard to handle those feelings. That means it has less energy left to fight off germs and help us feel better.”

Lila thought about this. “So... does that mean if I feel happier, I’ll get better faster?”

“Maybe,” said her mom with a smile. “It doesn’t mean we should never feel sad or scared. But talking about those feelings and learning how to feel calm again can help your body do its job. Doctors are even learning that helping people with their feelings is just as important as medicine.”

Just then, a soft breeze blew through Lila’s open window, and she thought she heard a little whisper, like the rustle of leaves.

“What was that?” she asked.

“That,” her mom said, “was the Worry Tree.”

“The Worry Tree?”

Her mom nodded. “Long ago, villagers planted that tree to remind everyone that it’s okay to share their worries. They would sit beneath it, talk to someone they trusted, and let their feelings out. They believed that when your heart feels a little lighter, your body feels a little stronger.”

Lila smiled. “Can I visit the Worry Tree tomorrow?”

“Of course,” her mom said. “But tonight, how about we plant a tiny pretend Worry Tree right here in your room?”

Together, they imagined a little tree growing beside Lila’s bed. It had soft green leaves and a trunk just the right size to hug.

“Now,” said her mom, “you can whisper your worries to the tree before bed. And in the morning, maybe you’ll feel just a bit better.”

So Lila whispered to her pretend Worry Tree:

“I’m scared it’s taking too long to get better.”
“I miss playing outside.”
“I hope I feel strong again soon.”

Then she closed her eyes.

And as the stars blinked gently above, Lila slept — peacefully, with a soft smile — and her little body quietly went to work healing.

The End. 🌙
