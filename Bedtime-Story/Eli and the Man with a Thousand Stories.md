# The Body Is The Servant Of The Mind (Bedtime Story Version)

### Eli and the Man with a Thousand Stories
Eli was the kind of boy who asked big questions. Not just “what’s for dinner?” or “can I get a puppy?”—but questions like:
* “Why do some people get sick so often?”
* “Why does someone look old when they’re still young?”
* “Why does being worried make my stomach hurt?”
One day, while wandering near the edge of the village, Eli found himself in front of a little wooden cabin with ivy curling around the windows. Sitting in a rocking chair out front was an old man with kind eyes and a beard like a snowy waterfall.
He was known as Old Theo, and the village said he’d traveled farther and lived longer than anyone else alive. Some said he once wrestled a bear (he hadn’t). Others claimed he knew the secret to a happy life (he did).
“Looking for something, boy?” Old Theo said with a smile.
Eli shrugged and answered, “Maybe.”
“Well, sit,” Theo said, patting the stool beside him. “I’ve got answers. But they come wrapped in stories.”

Story One: Miss Lily’s Light
“I once met a woman named Miss Lily,” Theo began. “She was 96 years old but looked like she was made of sunshine and morning dew. Her face had lines, sure, but they were laugh lines. Her eyes sparkled like a child’s. She spent her days baking cookies and planting flowers.”

“She wasn’t lucky, mind you. She lost her husband young. She worked hard every day. But her thoughts stayed gentle and full of hope. She once told me, ‘Theo, the world’s got enough dark. I keep a little light in my head so I can shine it wherever I go.’ And that’s just what she did.”
Theo paused, then looked at Eli. “What do you think her body did with all those happy thoughts?”
“It stayed strong,” Eli guessed.
“Exactly,” Theo nodded. “The body listens to the mind. Give it peace, and it moves with grace.”

Story Two: Mr. Grump’s Shadow
“Then there was Mr. Grump,” Theo continued. “He was young—maybe in his forties—but looked twice that. Always scowling, always expecting the worst.”

“He wasn’t born grumpy. But he chose to think the worst of people. He held onto anger like a blanket. Over time, his body curled in, tired and stiff. His face turned sour. Not because of age—because of thought.”
Theo leaned close. “You see, sour thoughts make a sour life. And the body can’t help but follow.”

Story Three: The Soldier of Fear
“I met a man once, a soldier, who was stronger than anyone I’d ever seen. But he was always afraid—afraid of getting sick, afraid of losing, afraid of failing.”
￼
🖼️ [Illustration idea: A strong-looking man in armor, hiding in a tent, surrounded by invisible monsters labeled ‘fear,’ ‘doubt,’ and ‘worry’.]

“He got sick more often than his weaker friends. Not because he was unlucky, but because fear tied his body in knots. Even the strongest person can't stay strong when fear is in charge.”

Eli listened with wide eyes.
“So... if I think bad things, it’s like I’m feeding my body poison?”
Theo grinned. “Not quite poison, but not exactly vitamins either. The body is like a garden, son. What you plant in your mind—joy, love, anger, fear—that’s what grows.”

Story Four: The Philosopher’s Peace
“I once sat beside a philosopher as he passed from this world,” Theo said gently. “He wasn’t very old, but you wouldn’t know it. His face was smooth, calm, like a lake at sunrise.”
￼
🖼️ [Illustration idea: An old man lying in bed, surrounded by books and loved ones, a peaceful smile on his face, golden light glowing from the window.]

“He had spent his life thinking kind, thoughtful, peaceful thoughts. He said, ‘I filled my mind with sunshine, and now I get to leave in the glow.’ He died smiling.”

Eli sat quietly for a while.
“Can I do that?” he finally asked. “Can I grow sunshine too?”
“You can,” Theo said. “But you have to choose it, every day. Choose thoughts of kindness over judgment. Choose hope over fear. Choose to see the good, even when it’s hard to find. And when you do, your body will feel the change. You’ll walk lighter, smile easier. Even your face will start to shine.”
“Does it work fast?” Eli asked.
Theo laughed. “Boy, nothing real grows in a day. But start planting now, and you’ll be surprised how fast your garden grows.”

From that day forward, Eli began to tend his “inner garden.” When he woke up, he thought a kind thought. When he got mad, he paused and looked for something good. He even started writing down the best thing that happened each day.
And sure enough, people started noticing. Eli stood taller. His laugh came easier. Even grumpy Mr. Grump cracked a smile one day.
He never forgot Old Theo’s stories.
And when Eli grew up, he told those stories to others—always starting with the same words:
“Let me tell you about someone I met…”
