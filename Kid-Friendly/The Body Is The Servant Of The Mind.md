# The Body Is The Servant Of The Mind (Kid-Friendly Version)

Your body is like a helper that listens to your mind. Whatever your mind tells it to do—whether you're thinking on purpose or just feeling something without really noticing—your body reacts to it.

If you’re always thinking about bad or mean things, your body can start to feel tired, sick, or weak. But if your mind is full of happy, kind, and beautiful thoughts, your body will feel younger, healthier, and even look better!

Being sick or healthy doesn’t just come from germs or what you eat—it also comes from what you think. If you’re always worried or scared, your body can get sick faster. Believe it or not, fear has hurt people just as badly as something like a bullet—sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. People who are scared of getting sick are often the ones who actually do get sick. Worrying too much makes your body feel weak and tired, and makes it easier for you to catch an illness. And even if someone doesn’t act on bad thoughts—like anger or jealousy—just thinking about them too much can mess up your body’s nerves and make you feel awful.

But here’s the good news: strong, kind, and happy thoughts make your body strong and graceful! Your body is kind of like clay that can be shaped by your thoughts. If your thoughts are good, your body will show that over time. If they’re not, your body will show that too.

As long as people keep thinking bad or dirty thoughts, their bodies will stay unhealthy. But when your heart (which means your mind and your feelings) is clean and full of kindness, your body and your life will be clean too. The way you think is like the root of a tree—if the root is good, the whole tree will be healthy. Changing what you eat isn’t going to help much if you don’t also change the way you think. But when your thoughts get better, you’ll find that you want better things—like better food, better friends, and better habits.

So if you want a strong and healthy body, take care of your thoughts first. If you want to feel young and fresh, think thoughts that are full of joy, kindness, and love. When you let yourself stay stuck in thoughts like being mad, jealous, or hopeless, your body will lose its strength and energy. And if you’re always frowning or grumpy, it’s not just by accident—it comes from unhappy thoughts.

Even wrinkles on your face can come from the way you think! Wrinkles caused by caring and love look different than wrinkles made from anger or selfishness. I once met a woman who was 96 years old, and her face looked bright and sweet like a young girl’s. But I also know a man who isn’t even that old, and his face looks tired and twisted. The woman had a happy, kind heart, and the man was always unhappy and upset.

It’s just like a house—you can’t have a fresh and lovely home if you don’t let in air and sunshine. In the same way, you can’t have a strong body and a cheerful face unless you let happy and loving thoughts into your mind. Old people’s faces tell a story: some show kindness, some show wisdom, and others show anger. You can often tell just by looking.

When someone lives a good and honest life, they grow old in a peaceful and gentle way—like how the sky looks at sunset. I saw a wise man not long ago who was about to die. He wasn’t really that old, but he was calm and sweet because he had always lived with peace in his heart.

Nothing helps the body like cheerful thoughts. And there’s no better way to feel better when you’re sad than to think kindly about other people. But if you always think badly about others—if you're always suspicious or jealous—you’re building a little prison for your own mind. You're locking yourself in.

But if you think kindly about everyone, if you try to be happy with others, and if you always look for the good in people, then your thoughts are like doors that open to a happy and peaceful life. When you think peaceful thoughts about everyone, peace will grow inside you, and it will stay with you, no matter what.
