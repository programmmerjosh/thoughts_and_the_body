# The Fear Of Ill Health & Its Symptoms (Kid-Friendly Version)

### Why Being Scared of Getting Sick Can Make Us Feel Worse
Sometimes, people are afraid of getting sick, even when they're not sick at all. That fear can come from stories they’ve heard, things they've read, or what they’ve seen happen to others. Long ago, people were told scary things about being old or dying, and those fears got passed down through families, just like stories or habits.
There are even people who have made money by keeping others afraid of being sick — like by selling them medicines they don’t really need.
Most of the time, people are scared of sickness because of two things:
1. They’re afraid of what might happen if they got really sick.
2. They worry about how much it might cost or how it would change their life.
One wise doctor once said that most people who come to the doctor aren’t actually sick — they just think they are. That means their mind is tricking them into feeling sick, even though their body is okay. This can happen when someone worries a lot.
Our minds are very powerful. They can help us feel better — or they can make us feel worse. Some people who sell “quick fix” medicines know this, and they’ve made a lot of money by making people afraid and then offering something to “fix” it.

### A Story from the Past
During a big sickness called the "flu" that spread around the world, the mayor of New York City noticed that the more people read scary news about it, the more worried they got — and the worse things became. So he told the newspapers: Please stop writing scary stories about the flu. And guess what? When the newspapers stopped spreading fear, the number of flu cases started to go down. People were calmer, and that helped them stay healthier.

### The Power of Suggestion
There was even an experiment once. Here’s what happened:
Three friends walked up to someone who was feeling just fine. The first one said, “Are you okay? You look tired.” The person smiled and said, “I’m fine!”
Then a second friend said, “Hmm, you really don’t look well.” The person frowned and said, “Yeah, I don’t feel great now that you mention it.”
Finally, the third friend said, “You look really sick. Maybe you should lie down!” And the person started to believe it — even though they were perfectly fine at the start.
This shows how what we hear — or even what we think — can affect how our body feels.

### Why Worrying Can Be Harmful
Doctors sometimes send people to new places — like to the mountains or the seaside — just to help them change how they think and feel. When people are worried, sad, or upset for a long time, it can actually make their body feel tired or sick.
Worry, fear, and sadness are like tiny seeds. If we give them too much attention, they grow into weeds that take over our healthy thoughts. This is why so many doctors were busy during hard times like the Great Depression — because stress can turn into sickness.

### Three Common Signs of “Fear of Getting Sick”
Here are some clues that someone is worrying too much about being sick:
1. Imaginary Illness (called “Hypochondria”):This is when someone keeps talking about being sick or reading about diseases until they actually start to feel sick — even if nothing is wrong. No medicine in a bottle can fix that. Only changing our thoughts from negative to positive can help.
2. Getting Sick More Easily:When people are scared of illness, their bodies don’t fight off germs as well. That means they can get sick more easily, just from being so worried all the time.
3. Unhealthy Habits:Some people try to feel better by taking things like too much medicine, or by drinking things that numb pain — instead of finding and fixing the real problem. Others read too much about scary illnesses and imagine the worst.

### The Good News
The good news is this: You have more power than you think!When you choose kind, hopeful, and peaceful thoughts, it helps your whole body feel stronger. If you're scared or worried, talk to someone you trust. And remember — just because a thought pops into your head doesn’t mean it’s true.
You can always choose to think thoughts that help you grow, not ones that make you feel small.
